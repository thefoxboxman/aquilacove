              <p style="text-align: left;">
                If you need a sea change or a tree change, Aquila Cove is just
                the sort of property you are looking for. Located right on the
                edge of the blue Pacific Ocean with hundreds of metres of sandy
                beach. Your secluded beach front sanctuary is close to the
                village of Carmila, north Queensland. Carmila has many amenities
                including primary school, store, hotel, police, ambulance,
                service station, several cafes, auto workshop, motel, and
                caravan park. The nearest domestic airport is in Mackay about
                100km drive away. Mackay is one of Queensland's main provincial
                cities.

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                The same family has owned Aquila Cove for three generations. The
                current owners are retiring. Regrettably the property must be
                sold. Aquila Cove has a total land area of approximately 68ha
                (162 acres). About a third is on the mainland and the other two
                thirds is a tidal island of pristine forest, with hundreds of
                metres of beach front. The island is separated from the mainland
                by a tidal zone. The northern and southern boundaries of the
                island are tidal creeks. The Pacific Ocean forms the eastern
                boundary.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                This is the ultimate sea change property with rare private beach
                frontage, abundant wildlife and natural beauty.

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                Mains electricity and telephone have been constructed to the
                property. The copper cable phone has been superseded by Internet
                services. Electricity and water are connected to the Studio and
                a big open shed. A pressure pump pressurises the line to town
                water standard. This supplies rainwater to the Studio. A bore,
                also equipped with mains powered pressure pump, provides a
                reliable supply of good quality water for farm and garden use.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                Fast and reliable NBN Wireless Internet is connected to the
                Studio. The current iiNet Internet package includes 250G of
                anytime download, plus internet phone with free calls to all
                Australian standard landlines and mobiles, for just $80 per
                month. The whole property has great mobile coverage.
                Communication towers for NBN, Telstra and Optus are in direct
                line of sight on the hill just south of Carmila.

                The "Studio" is a recently renovated liveable shed at the
                western end of Aquila Cove. At approximately 42 square metres in
                area the "Studio" has all the comforts of home. Main
                electricity, hot and cold running water, air-conditioning, and
                fast Internet. The "Studio" incorporates a bedroom, kitchen,
                bathroom, and laundry. Your solid base to relax while you

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                The two sheds have been constructed and provide the catchment
                for the water storage tanks. A large open shed has electricity
                connected, with power points and lights throughout. The
                machinery shed is 6m x 9m. Providing protection from the
                elements for Aquila Cove's range of equipment and tools. A
                shipping container provides weatherproof security for stored
                items and tools
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                There is an old set of stockyards under large shady trees down
                on the bank of Red Gully.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                A large dam collects and stores water runoff. This water could
                be used to irrigate a small area of cropping or even to grow Red
                Claw Crayfish
              </p>

              <h4>Boundary Fences</h4>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                Aquila Cove was resurveyed in 2012 to accurately locate all
                boundary pegs. The survey markers are now protected by fencing.
